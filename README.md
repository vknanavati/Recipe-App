A React-based recipe search app that helps users discover and organize recipes. The homepage features cuisine-based buttons (e.g., "American") that, when clicked, display recipe cards. Each card links to the full recipe externally but also allows users to save it to the "Make Recipe" page. There, users can generate an ingredient list, create a grocery list, and add personal notes. The app also includes a Favorites page, where users can save recipes with a heart icon. Built with React, JavaScript, Material UI, and React Router.
